 <h2>Background</h2>
  Belly Button Biodiversity, a biological research facility, recently partnered with Improbable Beef,
      a food
      start-up, to help facilitate the discovery of a unique bacteria with the capabilities of synthesizing proteins
      that taste similar to meat.
      The discovery will allow Improbable Beef to launch a new delicious alternative option to regular Beef.
